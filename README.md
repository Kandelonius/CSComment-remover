# Comment Remover

#### Program will read the clipboard and if there is text it will go line by line and 'remove' each line which has been single line commented out by checking if the first two characters are '//'. At this point the user will still need to manually paste the text.

#### How to use: Open the .sln file in visual studio and run the program, this will generate a .exe file. After you have the .exe file you can find it according to the create shortcut link below. I will endeavor to improve this process in the future.

##### Currently following the steps in the following pages for guidance on running the program on a users machine. [create shortcut](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/how-create-shortcuts/) --> [create custom hotkeys to run the program](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/start-windows-apps-keyboard-shortcut/)

###### May need [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50155078/how-to-unit-test-this-method-uses-clipboard-and-file-system) if I need to test clipboard dependent code.
###### TODO: create error file.
###### create or find a no comment indicator to run after the comments have been removed.
